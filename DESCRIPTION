Description: Implementation of 'LT-FH++', an extension of 'LT-FH',
    a liability threshold model conditioned on family history.
    'LT-FH++' uses a Gibbs sampler for sampling from the truncated 
    multivariate normal distribution and allows for 
    flexible family structures. 'LT-FH++' was first described in 
    Pedersen, Emil M., et al. (2022) 
    <https://pure.au.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/353346245/> 
    as an extension to LT-FH with more flexible family structures, 
    and again as "ADuLT" 
    Pedersen, Emil M., et al. (2023) 
    <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41210-z> 
    as an alternative to traditional time-to-event GWAS, 
    where family history was not considered.
