\title{Estimate genetic liability based off of family history and temporal information.}
\usage{
estimate_gen_liability(
  h2,
  phen,
  thr,
  ids = c("FID", "pid_f", "pid_m"),
  ind = c(1),
  status_cols = c("child_stat", "father_stat", "mother_stat"),
  nthreads = 10,
  tol = 0.01
)
}
\arguments{
\item{h2}{Liability scale heritability of the trait being analysed.}

\item{phen}{tibble or data.frame with the IDs and status of the genotyped individual and the parents and siblings.}

\item{thr}{tibble or data.frame with a row of each individual in the provided phen. Each row should contain the ID and threshold value needed for the model.}

\item{ids}{Column names of IDs for family members.}

\item{ind}{Indices to return from the gibbs sampler. 1 corresponds to the genetic liability of the first phenotype. c(1,5) corresponds to the genetic liability of the first two phenotypes provided, but with no siblings in the model.}

\item{status_cols}{Vector with the names of the columns that has the status of each family. default is c("child_stat", "father_stat", "mother_stat").}

\item{nthreads}{number of threads to use in estimating the genetic liabilities. Do not exceed the number of threads your CPU has available.}

\item{tol}{Convergence criteria of the gibbs sampler. Default is 0.01, meaning a standard error of the mean below 0.01}
