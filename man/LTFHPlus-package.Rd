\title{LTFHPlus: Implementation of LT-FH++}
\description{
Implementation of LT-FH++, an extension of the liability threshold family history (LT-FH) model. LT-FH++ uses a Gibbs sampler for sampling from the truncated multivariate normal distribution and allows for flexible family structures. LT-FH++ was first described in Pedersen, Emil M., et al. (2022) \url{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2022.01.009} as an extension to LT-FH with more flexible family structures, and again as the age-dependent liability threshold (ADuLT) model Pedersen, Emil M., et al. (2023) \url{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41210-z} as an alternative to traditional time-to-event genome-wide association studies, where family history was not considered.
