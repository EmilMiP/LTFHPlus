\title{Helps construct the correlation entries in the covariance matrix needed for LT-FH++ with multiple traits.}
\usage{
get_full_cov(corr_mat, n_sib = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{corr_mat}{Matrix containing the heritabilities and correlations for each of the phenotypes provided. Heritabilities should be on the diagonal with the corresponing off-diagonal entry holding the correlation between two phenotypes.}

\item{n_sib}{Number of Siblings to include in the matrix.}
}
\value{
Returns the full covariance matrix based off of the heritabilities and corralations provided in corr_mat.
}
\description{
